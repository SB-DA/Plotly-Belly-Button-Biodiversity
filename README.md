# Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity
Building interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of belly buttons and deploying dashboard to a cloud server.

## Overview
Rosa is a biological researcher working for a well-established Microbiology Laboratory. Many bacterial species are not well studied and, many are unknown to Science. Rosa's role is to discover and document these bacteria. Recently, her lab partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup company to research the right bacterial species that has the ability to synthesis proteins that tastes like beef.
Rosa hypothesized that the ideal species of the microorganism may be found in the belly button which can help make synthetic beef. to test this, she had sampled the naval's of people from across the countries to identify the bacterial species. 
Each person's identity was anonymous and, they were assigned an ID number. Now rosa wanted to build a dashboard that both her participants and fellow researchers can access. Those who participated in the study will be able to, visit a website and select their ID number to see which bacterial species is living in their naval.


## Challenge Overview
Roza had a partially completed dashboard that she had to finish. She had a completed panel for demographic information and needed to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers were suppose to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
